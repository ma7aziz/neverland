                   <p> Our story began in 2006 in <strong>Nasr city branch.</strong>  <br>
                    our company was founded at this year and through this time we were the perfect company choice to
                    sell
                    costumes for (costume parties-events) all over the country. <br>
                    <strong>The second step </strong> was the Maadi branch in march2008 and this branch was the widespread branch between
                    our
                    costumer. <br>
                    <strong>The third step </strong>was Zamalek branch in 2010 and this branch didnâ€™t last more 1 year because the 25th
                    January Egyptian revolution and the effect of it on the security and the people. <br>
                    In 2014 the third branch is opened in <strong>6 October city </strong> in Cityscape mall. <br>
                    We take a big step in 2015 to change the <strong>Nasr City branch </strong> to the other side from the street to be
                    our
                    biggest and main shop. <br>
                    The current step for us is the new branch in <strong>Maxim mall in New Cairo</strong>. <br></p>
